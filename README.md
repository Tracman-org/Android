# <img align="left" src="https://www.tracman.org/static/img/icon/by/48.png" alt="[]" title="The Tracman Logo">Tracman for Android
###### v 0.6.1

Android app to upload a user's GPS location to the [tracman server](https://github.com/tracman-org/Server). Cloned from [fs/android-base](https://github.com/fs/android-base). 

## Installation

Install from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.keithirwin.tracman) or with `adb`/Android Studio. 

## Usage

In order to apply changes to settings, you need to hit the back button and return to the main menu (where it just says "General settings").  Don't hit back again, or you will be logged out.  This will be fixed as [#9](https://github.com/Tracman-org/Android/issues/9) someday... 

The app will switch between "realtime updates" (Every second, or whatever interval you set up in the settings) and "occasional updates", depending on if there are visitors to your map.  This prevents the app from draining your battery when nobody's looking at your location anyway. 

More information is available on the [help page](https://www.tracman.org/help#android).
